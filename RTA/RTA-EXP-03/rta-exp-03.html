            <h2>We’re called <span>RTA Outdoor Kitchen</span> for a reason</h2>
            <p>
              RTA Outdoor Kitchen was created with the intention of providing
              you with a Ready To Assemble product. Let our team do all the
              heavy lifting by taking a complicated, labor and cost-intensive
              process, and simplify it for you. Our one-of-a-kind product is
              made of structured pannels that makes for an assembly process that
              takes a few hours to finish.
